# Media Metadata Extraction & Search

## Overview

The Media Search Solution is a comprehensive, cloud-native application designed for organizations and developers who need to manage, analyze, and search large libraries of video content. By leveraging the power of Google Cloud and AI, this solution automates the entire process of video ingestion, metadata extraction, and intelligent analysis, making your video assets easily discoverable and queryable.

### What does it do?

When you deploy this solution, it sets up an automated pipeline on Google Cloud that:

1.  **Ingests Videos:** Watches for new video uploads to a designated Cloud Storage bucket.
1.  **Processes Media:** Automatically creates low-resolution proxy versions for efficient playback and analysis.
1.  **Extracts Intelligence:** Uses Google's Gemini models to analyze video content and extract rich metadata, such as object detection, scene descriptions, and key topics.
1.  **Persists Data:** Stores all extracted metadata and analysis results in a structured BigQuery dataset.
1.  **Enables Search:** Deploys a secure web application on Cloud Run that allows users to perform powerful, AI-driven searches across the entire video library.

The end result is a fully functional, searchable video archive that transforms your raw video files into a valuable, queryable data source.

### Who is this for?

This solution is ideal for:

*   **Media & Entertainment companies** looking to catalog and search their vast archives of video content. These include specific sectors such as:
    -  News organizations
    -  Sports entities
    -  Film and television production companies
*   **Marketing and advertising agencies** needing to analyze video campaigns and identify trends.
*   **Developers or organizations** with substantial video libraries who are looking to build or enhance AI-powered search and analysis capabilities, especially those who prefer a "build" approach for greater control and customization.

### Technical Design

The processing pipeline is built on the Chain of Responsibility (COR) design pattern. Each unit of work is atomic, and state is conveyed via a shared context object to each link in the chain.

## Deployment Guide

This section provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the `Media Search Solution` on Google Cloud.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have an active Google Cloud project with billing enabled.

Once the project is set up, the identity deploying the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) resources needs the following [IAM Roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview) on the target Google Cloud project:

**Note:** If you already have the broader role like `Owner` (`roles/owner`) or `Editor` (`roles/editor`) you can skip setting the specific role. However, best practices for security are to use least privilege, if so, follow these guidelines.

*   **Service Usage Admin** (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`): To enable project APIs.
*   **Artifact Registry Admin** (`roles/artifactregistry.admin`): To create the container image repository.
*   **Storage Admin** (`roles/storage.admin`): To create Cloud Storage buckets.
*   **BigQuery Admin** (`roles/bigquery.admin`): To create the BigQuery dataset and tables.
*   **Service Account Admin** (`roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin`): To create service accounts for Cloud Build and the Cloud Run service.
*   **Project IAM Admin** (`roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`): To grant project-level permissions to the newly created service accounts.
*   **Cloud Build Builder** (`roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder`): To run the build job that creates the container image.
*   **Cloud Run Admin** (`roles/run.admin`): To deploy the application to Cloud Run.

### Create infrastructure resources on Google Cloud
1. **Set up your environment.** To deploy the solution, you can use [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/?show=ide%2Cterminal), which comes pre-installed with the necessary tools. Alternatively, if you prefer a local terminal, ensure you have installed and configured the following:
    * [Git CLI](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
    * [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and [initialize](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI
    * [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started/install-cli)

1. **Clone the repository.** In your terminal, clone the solution's source code and change into the new directory:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/media-search-solution.git
    cd media-search-solution
    ```
1. **Set script permissions.** Grant execute permission to all the script files in the `scripts` directory:
    ```sh
    chmod +x scripts/*.sh
    ```

1. **Run the setup script.** This script automates the initial setup by checking for required tools, logging you into Google Cloud, enabling necessary APIs, and creating a `terraform.tfvars` file from the example.
    ```sh
    scripts/setup_terraform.sh
    ```
1. **Configure your deployment variables.** The setup script created the `build/terraform/terraform.tfvars` file. Open this file and set the values for the following variables:

    |Terraform variable|Description|
    |---|---|
    |project_id|Your Google Cloud project ID.|
    |high_res_bucket|A unique name for the Cloud Storage bucket that will store high-resolution media (e.g., "media-high-res-your-project-id").|
    |low_res_bucket|A unique name for the Cloud Storage bucket that will store low-resolution media (e.g., "media-low-res-your-project-id").|
    |config_bucket|A unique name for the Cloud Storage bucket that will store solution configuration files (e.g., "media-search-configs-your-project-id").|
    |region|(Optional) The Google Cloud region for deployment. Defaults to `us-central1`.|

1. **Navigate to the Terraform directory**:
    ```sh
    cd build/terraform
    ```
1. **Initialize Terraform**:
    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```
1. **Deploy the resources.** Apply the Terraform configuration to create the Google Cloud resources. You will be prompted to review the plan and confirm the changes by typing `yes`:
    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```
    The provisioning process may take approximately 30 minutes to complete.

### Deploy the Media Search service on Cloud Run
After Terraform has successfully created the infrastructure and built the container image, the final step is to deploy the application to Cloud Run and configure its access policies.

1. **Run the deployment script.** From your project root directory, execute the deployment script:
    ```bash
    scripts/deploy_media_search.sh
    ```
    This script automates the following steps:
    *   Deploys the container to Cloud Run using the configuration from your Terraform outputs.
    *   Configures Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) to secure your application.
    *   Prompts you to add IAP access policies for users or domains to access the web application.
    *   Prompts you to grant permissions for users or domains to upload files to the high-resolution bucket and view files in the low-resolution bucket.

    The script takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. Once finished, it will output the URL for the Media Search application.

    **NOTE:** IAP for Cloud Run is in Preview. This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms. Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For official IAP setup, follow the [Enable IAP for load balancer guide](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/enabling-cloud-run#enable-from-iap)

## Usage Guide

This guide walks you through the basic steps of using the Media Search solution after it has been successfully deployed.

### 1. Accessing the Media Search Application

Once the deployment script finishes, it will output the URL for your Media Search web application.

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by the `deploy_media_search.sh` script.
1.  You will be prompted to sign in with a Google account. Ensure you are using an account that has been granted "IAP-secured Web App User" permissions during the deployment step.

### 2. Testing the Video Processing Pipeline

To test the end-to-end processing workflow, you need to upload a video file to the high-resolution Cloud Storage bucket created during deployment.

#### 2.1. Uploading a Video

**Option 1:**  Run the following command to get a URL to the Google Cloud console. Navigate to the URL in a web browser and upload your video file through the UI.

```sh
echo "https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/$(terraform -chdir="build/terraform" output -raw high_res_bucket)?project=$(terraform -chdir="build/terraform" output -raw project_id)"
```

**Option 2:**.  Use the `gsutil` command-line tool to upload a video file. Replace `<YOUR_VIDEO_FILE>` with the path to your video.

```sh
gsutil cp <YOUR_VIDEO_FILE> gs://$(terraform -chdir="build/terraform" output -raw high_res_bucket)/
```

Uploading a file to this bucket automatically triggers the video processing workflow.

#### 2.2. Monitoring the Workflow

You can monitor the progress of the video processing by viewing the logs of the Cloud Run service. The following command will get url to the Google Cloud console and navigate to the url in a web browser.
```sh
echo "https://console.cloud.google.com/run/detail/$(terraform -chdir="build/terraform" output -raw cloud_run_region)/$(terraform -chdir="build/terraform" output -raw cloud_run_service_name)/logs?project=$(terraform -chdir="build/terraform" output -raw project_id)"
```
Look for log entries related to the processing of your uploaded file. A key log entry to watch for is: `Persisting data`. This message indicates that the video analysis is complete and the extracted metadata is being written to BigQuery.

**NOTE:** The Cloud Run service scales to zero after 15 minutes of inactivity (`[INFO] Shutdown Server ...` will appear in logs). In this case, visit the web application to activate a new instance.


### 3. Searching for Media Content

Once the processing is finished, you can use the web application to search for content within your video.

1.  Navigate back to the Media Search application URL in your browser.
2.  In the search bar, enter a free-text query related to the content of the video you uploaded. For example, if your video contains a scene with a car, you could search for "car".
3.  The application will display a list of video scenes that have a high correlation with your search term. You can play the specific scenes and view scene descriptions directly in the browser.

**Note:** IAP permission changes can take up to 7 minutes to propagate. If you encounter a `You don't have access` page, please wait a few minutes and then refresh your browser.

**Note:** The first time the application loads content from Google Cloud Storage, Google's [Endpoint Verification](https://cloud.google.com/endpoint-verification/docs/overview) may prompt you to select a client certificate.
If this occurs, choose the certificate issued by `Google Endpoint Verification` from the list.

### 4. Customizing Media Analysis

The Media Search Solution is configured with general-purpose prompts for analyzing video content. However, to achieve the best results for your specific use case, it is highly recommended that you customize the AI prompts to align with the nature of your media library.

For example:
*   If you are analyzing **sports footage**, you might want to extract key plays, player names, and game statistics.
*   For **news reports**, you might focus on identifying speakers, locations, and key events.
*   For **product reviews**, extracting product names, features mentioned, and sentiment would be crucial.

By tailoring the prompts, you guide the AI to extract the most relevant and valuable metadata for your needs, which significantly enhances the accuracy and usefulness of the search results.

For detailed instructions on how to modify the content type, summary, and scene analysis prompts, please refer to the [Prompt Configuration Guide](docs/PromptConfiguration.md).

### 5. Cleaning Up a Media File

If you need to remove a specific video and all its associated data (including proxy files and metadata), you can use the `cleanup_media_file.sh` script. This is useful for testing or for removing content that is no longer needed.

The script performs the following actions:
*   Deletes the original video from the high-resolution Cloud Storage bucket.
*   Deletes the generated proxy video from the low-resolution Cloud Storage bucket.
*   Deletes all associated metadata records from the BigQuery tables.

To run the cleanup script, execute the following command from the root of the repository, replacing `<VIDEO_FILE_NAME>` with the name of the file you want to delete (e.g., `my-test-video.mp4`):

```sh
scripts/cleanup_media_file.sh <VIDEO_FILE_NAME>
```
**Note:** BigQuery does not support DML operations (`UPDATE`, `DELETE`) on data recently streamed into a table.
Attempt to modify recently written rows will trigger the following error:

```
UPDATE or DELETE statement over table ... would affect rows in the streaming buffer, which is not supported
```

To resolve this, wait for the buffer to clear (this can take up to 90 minutes) before re-running the script. For more details, see [BigQuery DML Limitations](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/data-manipulation-language#limitations).
