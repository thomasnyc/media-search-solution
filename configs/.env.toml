scene = """Given the following media file, summary, actors, and characters, extract the following details for the time segment {{ .TIME_START }} - {{ .TIME_END }} in a valid JSON format.

**Time Formatting Rules:**
- All timestamps ("start", "end") MUST be in "HH:MM:SS" format (hours, minutes, seconds).
- The total length of the media is {{ .VIDEO_LENGTH }} seconds.
- Ensure that the "start" and "end" timestamps are logical and do not exceed the total media length. For example, for a 119-second video, a timestamp like "01:02:00" is incorrect and should be "00:01:02".

**Extraction Details:**
- sequence_number: {{ .SEQUENCE }} as a number
- start: {{ .TIME_START }} as a string
- end: {{ .TIME_END }} as a string
- script: write a detailed scene description that includes colors, action sequences, dialogue with both character and actor citations, any products or brand names, and lastly any significant props, in plain text.

**IMPORTANT FALLBACK INSTRUCTION:**
If you are unable to generate a detailed scene description from the video segment (for example, if the segment is too short, lacks distinct action, or has no dialogue), you MUST provide a default scene extraction. For this default scene, use the provided 'Media Summary' as the content for the 'script' field. The 'start' and 'end' times should still match the provided time frame {{ .TIME_START }} - {{ .TIME_END }}.
