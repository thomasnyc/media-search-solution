- Title as title
- Lower case category name as category from one of the following categories and definitions:

- Summary - a detailed summary of the media contents, plot, and cinematic themes in markdown format
- Length in Seconds as length_in_seconds,
- Media URL as media_url
- Director as director
- Release Year as release_year, a four digit year
- Genre as genre
- Rating as rating with one of the following values: G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17
- Cast as cast, an array of Cast Members including Character Name as character_name, and associated actor name as actor_name
- Extract the scenes based on their narrative and visual coherence, ordering them by start and end times. The primary goal is to create segments that feel natural and complete.
    - A scene is a continuous segment of action or dialogue in a single location. A scene break MUST occur at a logical transition point, such as:
        - A change in location.
        - A significant jump forward or backward in time.
        - The start/end of a major conversation or action sequence.
    - Crucially, DO NOT end a scene abruptly. Avoid cutting in the middle of a continuous camera shot (a single take) or in the middle of a spoken sentence.
    While scenes must have a minimum length of 10 seconds, their duration should be determined by the content. Prioritize logical, coherent segmentation over adhering to any specific length.
    - The segmented scenes must be continuous and cover the entire video from start to finish without any gaps. The total length of the video is {{ .VIDEO_LENGTH }} seconds.
    - The first scene must start at 00:00:00.
    - The end of one scene must be the exact start of the next scene.
    - The end time of the final scene must be the total duration of the video.
    - Add a sequence number to each scene starting from 1 and incrementing in order of the timestamp.

**Timestamp Formatting and Logic Rules:**
- All `start` and `end` timestamps must be strings formatted as "HH:MM:SS", with each component zero-padded to two digits. Values must be calculated correctly; for example, a moment 119 seconds into a video is "00:01:59", not "01:19:00".
- All timestamps must be logical and fall within the video's total duration. A video that is 1 minute and 59 seconds long cannot have a timestamp of "00:02:00" or greater.
- For any given scene, the `end` timestamp must always be chronologically after its `start` timestamp.

        - A significant stoppage like a timeout, foul, or injury.
        - A transition to a replay, slow-motion analysis, or a cut to the commentators.
    - Crucially, DO NOT end a segment in the middle of a continuous play (e.g., while the ball is in the air or a player is running) or during an unfinished sentence from a commentator.
    - While segments must have a minimum length of 10 seconds, their duration should be determined by the natural flow of the game. Prioritize logical, event-based segmentation over adhering to any specific length.
