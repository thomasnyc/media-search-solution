IntelliJ and Bazel work very well together, especially when using
multiple languages. That being said, there are some steps to follow
to make it operate well.

## Go Lang tool setup

Since this if for IntelliJ Ultimate, you should install a couple of the 
go tools first and ensure they are on your path. View the [Workstation Setup](WorkstationSetup.md)
file at the root for more information.

## Plugins

Install the following plugins:

* Go
* Bazel
* Terraform
* Google Cloud Code

> If you set up your environment correct, you're ready to go (pun intended)
> Otherwise, you'll need to configure your buildifier path on the Bazel tab.

## Importing a bazel project

Once you've restarted you're IDE, you'll see the ability to import a bazel project.
Click on that button and navigate to the project directory.

You'll be presented with a configuration screen, below is a working configuration
you should copy and paste.

```yaml
directories:
  # Add the directories you want added as source here
  # By default, we've added your entire workspace ('.')
  -bazel-bin
  -bazel-out
  -bazel-testlogs
  -bazel-vide-warehouse-go
  -.bazelrc
  -video-warehouse.code-workspace
  -.trunk
  .

# Automatically includes all relevant targets under the 'directories' above
derive_targets_from_directories: true

targets:
  # If source code isn't resolving, add additional targets that compile it here

additional_languages:
  go
  javascript
  typescript
```

## Finalize
Now you're ready to go. If you want a clean file tree, click on the vertical "..."
on the project explorer, and choose "appearance > (uncheck) Exclude files.". This
will exclude the normally hidden files.

You may build and synchronize using the "Bazel" menu on the system tray.
