INT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

A fierce battle is raging. Soldiers are fighting and dying all around.

VOICEOVER (V.O.) - (Nathan Fillion)
I aim to misbehave.

We see a young woman, RIVER TAM (16), running through the battlefield. She is terrified and covered in blood.

RIVER (V.O.) - (Summar Glau)
They were right. They were always right.

River stumbles and falls. She looks up to see a man standing over her. He is SIMON TAM (26), her older brother.

SIMON - (Sean Maher)
It's all right, River. I'm here.

Simon helps River to her feet. They run away together.`}
